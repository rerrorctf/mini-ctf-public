flag format: flag{**************}

pwn this locally!

make a file called flag.txt in the same directory as the binary

one day we'll be able to afford a remote to pwn :)

**note**

you can approach this exercise two ways:

1) treat it as a BLIND pwn as if you only have the remote
2) treat it as a pwn with the option of reversing the binary

ask us if you have any questions / trouble!
