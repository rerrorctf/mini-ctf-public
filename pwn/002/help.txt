pwn this locally!

you can either run it with docker compose:

$ sudo docker compose up

or just run the binary locally by itself

one day we'll be able to afford a remote to pwn :)

**note**

you can approach this exercise two ways:

1) treat it as a BLIND pwn as if you only have the remote
2) treat it as a pwn with the option of reversing the binary

ask us if you have any questions / trouble!
